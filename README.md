# Job Intel Platform

A local job discovery prototype for students and early career applicants in India. It collects public job listings from supported career sites, stores them in SQLite, and ranks them against an uploaded resume.

## What works

- Platform-specific collectors for career sites and job boards, with a shared job format.
- Location filtering, duplicate detection, job classification, skill extraction, and experience extraction.
- PDF, DOCX, and TXT resume upload. Matching combines `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` semantic similarity with explicit skill overlap.
- React interface backed by FastAPI, using the same local database and matching code as the collector.

This is a prototype. Match percentages are ranking scores, not validated probabilities of being hired or being eligible. Some job sources can change or become unavailable; a saved listing may have closed since it was collected. Application form automation is not implemented.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Node.js and npm for the React interface
- Internet access for collecting jobs and downloading the sentence-transformer model on first use

No API key or `.env` file is needed for the current collectors. The database and model cache are created locally and are excluded from Git.

## Run locally

In PowerShell, from the repository root:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

`python run.py` fetches listings and processes new rows. The first run may take several minutes. To see source counts from the most recent run:

```powershell
python stats.py
```

Run the React interface and FastAPI in two terminals after installing the Python requirements:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```powershell
cd ui-react
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. Alternatively, run `npm run build` in `ui-react`, then serve the built interface from `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with the FastAPI command above.

## How it works

1. [`config.py`](config.py) lists companies and search filters. [`fetchers/`](fetchers/) contains separate adapters for ATS APIs and HTML career pages.
2. [`run.py`](run.py) runs the collectors, keeps India or unknown-location listings, deduplicates them, and saves them in `db/jobs.db`.
3. [`core/`](core/) classifies jobs and extracts skills and experience requirements. Resume text is extracted with PyMuPDF, `python-docx`, or UTF-8 decoding.
4. [`core/matcher.py`](core/matcher.py) embeds resume and job text, compares them with cosine similarity, then blends that score with recognized skill overlap. The API supports correcting detected resume skills; the React UI does not yet expose that control.

For the complete data flow, schema, API behavior, and code change points, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Proposed work is tracked in [improvement.md](improvement.md).

The app is intended for local, single-user use. The FastAPI server has no authentication and should be bound to localhost. Respect each source site's access rules when running collectors.

## Repository data

`db/jobs.db` stores collected listings and local actions such as dismissals. `db/job_embeddings_cache.pt` stores generated embeddings. Both are excluded from Git, along with virtual environments, React dependencies, and build output. A fresh clone starts with an empty database until the collector runs.
